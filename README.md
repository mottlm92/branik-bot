# branik-bot  
![example workflow](https://github.com/mottlm92/branik-bot/actions/workflows/rust.yml/badge.svg)

A Reddit bot written in Rust that reacts to posts and comments in r/czech subreddit specifying any amount of money in Czech Koruna currency and conveniently converts it to amount of 2L Branik's one can purchase for that amount.

Heavily inspired by u/fabia-bot
